# Crash AUTOSAR

This guide aims to provide an introduction to the foundational knowledge, code practices, and various online resources necessary for entering the field of AUTOSAR. It's designed to help individuals interested in automotive software development quickly grasp the essential knowledge in AUTOSAR.

## Motivation

While I have spent several years in the automotive industry, my previous exposure to AUTOSAR was limited to conceptual understanding, without hands-on experience in project development. However, due to current work requirements, I now need to participate in AUTOSAR application layer development. This guide serves as a starting point, allowing me to build knowledge from scratch and gradually accumulate expertise in collaboration with others.

Currently, I might primarily focus on maintaining the documentation in Chinese.
