# Crash AUTOSAR

This guide aims to provide an introduction to the foundational knowledge, code practices, and various online resources related to AUTOSAR. Its aim is to help individuals interested in this field to quickly grasp relevant knowledge about automotive software development.

## Motivation

Although I have been working in the automotive field for many years, my previous understanding of AUTOSAR was limited to basic concepts, and I lacked experience in actual project development. However, due to current work requirements, I now need to participate in a portion of AUTOSAR application layer development. With the help of this document, I hope to start from scratch and gradually accumulate knowledge, aiming for mutual progress.

Currently, I might primarily focus on maintaining the documentation in Chinese.
